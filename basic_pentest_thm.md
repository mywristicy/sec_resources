# Note Space for Basic Pentesting Room in THM

- Started off with nmap scan ```nmap -sV -A [IP ADDR] -T4 -vv```
- Found port 80 was open and running Apache. 8080 also open and running Apache Tomcat(?)
-- Will try to search for directories here.
- Other Open Ports: 22, 139, 445, 8009
- Used gobuster for directory enumeration ```gobuster dir -u http://[IP ADDR] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt```. Only found the 'development' directory.
- Going to this directory in our browser brings us to an index page with two text files. Not much but just mentions that the password J is vulnerable to being cracked easily.
- The next step is asking us to use brute-forcing to find usernames & passwords. Not sure what to do here so I watched John Hammond's vid on this room and he suggested using enum4linux. I used ```enum4linux -4`` which gave me an incorrect error message but still showed me a list of commands similar to a help page. Here I was able to locate enum4linux.
- I then ran ```enum4linux -a [IP ADDR]``` and let it run. Afterwards I was presented with 2 usernames, Jan and Kay.
- From here we need to get a password for the Jan account based on our findings earlier and we can use Hydra for this. ```hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://[IP ADDR]``` After the attack completes, we are presented with the password 'armando'.
