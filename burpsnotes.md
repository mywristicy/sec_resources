## General Burp Suite notes
- *Response Interception*: By default the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis.
- The "Intercept responses based on the following rules" checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.
- Search for "Response intercept rules" in settings to find this. Should be under "Proxy".
