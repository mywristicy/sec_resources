# Cyber Security Links and Resources
---
#### *This will be a list of various resources I have encountered while studying various topics relating to security. I will do my best to categorize them based on purpose. Will be a continous work in progress.*

## OSINT
- https://osintframework.com/
-- From the site's homepage, "OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost."

- https://urlscan.io/
-- From tryhackme, "... is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions. When a URL is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the web page, technologies utilised and other metadata about the website. The site provides two views, the first one showing the most recent scans performed and the second one showing current live scans."
